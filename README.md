## Sales

The whole project started as minimalistic application carrying daily sales,
basic reporting and utilities for handling updating data.

The application can serve other purposes for the author.

Included in the repository is the last archived database and other init tools.
Init-ing/seeding the db is not documented.

If you are using or trying to use this application please note the author.
There are lots of todos.

### Updating 
Updating data is still rudimentary. No automation is implemented yet.
Updating terminals and agents should go throu system data.

Repo updates should also come with at least monthly db updates.

### Commission letters
Using _Commission letters_ from this application should start regularly updating
repo and db. Until then, updates are sporadic.
